1,"A Big Florida Poll, Nevada Tightens, Trump on Defense: This Week in the 2020 Race","In good news for President Trump, the Cook Political Report made two changes to its elections forecast, moving Florida from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up,” and moving Nevada from “Likely Democrat” to “Lean Democrat.” Trump advisers view Florida in particular as must-win. The shifts reflect Mr. Biden’s potential weakness with Latino voters, and Trump’s poll numbers stabilizing after months of protests after the killing of George Floyd.The Biden campaign continues to dominate the airwaves, spending $32 million on broadcast television over the past week, while the Trump campaign spent only about $10 million. Spending is nearly even on Facebook, as the Biden campaign spent $3.7 million over the past week while the Trump team spent $3.2 million on the platform.A Monmouth University poll released this week showed Biden holding a seven-point lead over Trump among likely voters nationwide. Among all registered voters, just 37 percent said they were certain they would vote for Trump, versus 43 percent who were sure they would be voting for Biden.But an NBC News/Marist College survey of Florida offered some rare positive news for the president on the polling front: He and Biden were tied at 48 percent each among likely voters in the state, with Trump supported by 50 percent of Latino voters (albeit a particularly hard demographic to accurately poll).For the president, the week began with him defending himself against a report in The Atlantic and ended with him defending himself against a report by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward.Both story lines — one about his alleged disrespect for the military, the other, about purposefully playing down the deadly nature of the coronavirus — threatened to undermine his standing with voters whose support he is counting on, especially servicemembers and seniors. Mr. Trump, himself, was once again the story, less than 55 days away from the election — a time when veteran political strategists said the person who the race is a referendum on is frequently the person who is losing.Mr. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president, tried to capitalize on the negative news reports during an appearance in Michigan, where he blamed the president’s handling of the pandemic for the ongoing recession. In contrast, Mr. Trump, also in Michigan, tried to push a message about a great American comeback, complete with the revival of packed, old-school Trump rallies he’s now holding regularly at airport hangars in battleground states.",https://nytimes.com/2020/09/12/us/politics/trump-scandals-woodward-midwest.html?searchResultPosition=1,"A Big Florida Poll, Nevada Tightens, Trump on Defense: This Week in the 2020 Race

2,"As Courts Back Broad Mail-In Voting, DeJoy Apologizes for Missteps","Courts on both sides of the United States issued rulings on Thursday that could expand mail-in voting in the election in November, as the postmaster general privately apologized to state officials for missteps in his agency’s efforts to educate voters on mail-in ballots.In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court paved the way for more mail-in ballots to be counted by extending the due date they must be received by election officials and allowing expanded use of drop boxes.In Washington State, a federal judge blocked operational and policy changes made by the Postal Service in recent months that have slowed mail delivery and amounted to “voter disenfranchisement.”Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who instituted those changes, conceded during a video conference with election officials on Thursday afternoon that he had failed to adequately consult with state election officials on a postcard that was sent to addresses nationwide to educate voters about mail-in ballots. The apology came as some state election officials had publicly clashed with the Postal Service over mail voting, including accusing Mr. DeJoy and his team of deliberately providing misinformation about how to vote by mail.",https://nytimes.com/2020/09/17/us/politics/usps-louis-dejoy.html?searchResultPosition=2,"As Courts Back Broad Mail-In Voting, DeJoy Apologizes for Missteps

3,Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dies: This Week in the 2020 Race,"Joe Biden continues to dominate the paid media landscape. On broadcast television, the Biden campaign spent $36.5 million over the last week, while the Trump campaign only spent about $14.7 million, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. The Biden campaign has a similar advantage on Facebook, where it spent $4.2 million over the past week, while President Trump’s team spent $2.4 million.A series of New York Times/Siena College surveys in seven battleground states generated mostly positive news for Mr. Biden, who didn’t trail in a single survey. Mr. Trump failed to reach 45 percent support in any poll. Support for Mr. Biden ranged from 45 percent to 55 percent.With Mr. Biden pushing back on the president’s aggressive law-and-order messaging, 53 percent of likely voters in Minnesota and Wisconsin said they thought that Mr. Trump had encouraged violence in America.In Wisconsin there was evidence of some possible receptiveness to Mr. Trump’s tough talk: It was the only state polled in which voters were just as likely to say that urban rioting was a bigger problem than racism in the criminal justice system, not the other way around.But of those more worried about riots, nearly one in five said they planned to vote for Mr. Biden.Late Friday night, the Supreme Court announced that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died from complications of metastatic pancreas cancer. The news immediately upended the presidential race, as the death of Supreme Court Justice so synonymous with liberal values presented an opportunity for Mr. Trump and a challenge for Mr. Biden. After months of relative stability in the race, a Senate confirmation fight might aid a president searching for a political lifeline and trying to make the campaign about something other than a referendum on his handling of the pandemic. Democrats immediately clamored for Mr. Biden to find a way to counter Republican efforts and hold Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to the same standard he set in 2016, when he refused to fill the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia under former President Barack Obama. The shock came in a week that otherwise seemed remarkably normal. Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden each participated in town hall forums, moderated by ABC News and CNN, which included questions from voters that could not be shrugged off with claims of fake news or media bias. Both candidates also visited Minnesota on Friday, in a push from each party now that early voting has begun in several states. Mr. Trump hit Nevada and Wisconsin as well, while Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate, made stops in Philadelphia and California.",https://nytimes.com/2020/09/19/us/politics/presidential-election-biden-trump.html?searchResultPosition=2,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dies: This Week in the 2020 Race for the White House

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 (UPI) -- A federal appeals court ruled Monday that a federal judge's ruling that the Obama administration's ban on gay marriage violates the First Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law, according to a statement from the conservative group Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AUSTR). The ruling comes after a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of a gay couple who sued the government over the state's refusal to allow them to marry in their home state of Texas.The ruling, issued by the 5th U, comes as the court prepares to hear oral arguments on a case challenging the legality of same sex marriage in Texas, a state that has long been a hotbed of anti-LGBT sentiment.In the case, the couples argued that Texas' ban was unconstitutional because it discriminated against them based on their sexual orientation, not their gender identity or gender expression.""This is an important victory for all Americans who believe in equality and freedom of religion and belief,"" said American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) President Chad Griffin. ""This case is not about whether or not Texas should be allowed to discriminate against gays or lesbians. It is about who is allowed in this country to live their lives as they see fit.""The case was brought by a group of gay and lesbian couples who said they were denied marriage licenses because they did not identify as gay or lesbian because of their religious beliefs.""We are very pleased with the decision and look forward to working with our colleagues to ensure that this case does not come back to court,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in an email to The Associated Press.Kennedy, who was appointed to the high court by former President Barack Obama, said the ruling was a ""major victory"" for gay rights and said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by what he called the ""unprecedented"" ruling.He said it was the first time he had ever heard of such a ruling.""I am very happy with this decision,"" Kennedy said in his statement. He added that he hoped the justices would take up the issue of whether Texas's law violated the Constitution's guarantees of due process and equality of opportunity.",Huggingface

When it came to his own safety, he said, “I’m not at all concerned.”The decision to hold a rally indoors, officials said, was something of a last resort for a campaign that had tried to procure five different outdoor locations.

6,"As Trump Again Rejects Science, Biden Calls Him a ‘Climate Arsonist’","WASHINGTON — With wildfires raging across the West, climate change took center stage in the race for the White House on Monday as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called President Trump a “climate arsonist” while the president said that “I don’t think science knows” what is actually happening.A day of dueling appearances laid out the stark differences between the two candidates, an incumbent president who has long scorned climate change as a hoax and rolled back environmental regulations and a challenger who has called for an aggressive campaign to curb the greenhouse gases blamed for increasingly extreme weather.Mr. Trump flew to California after weeks of public silence about the flames that have forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, wiped out communities and forests, burned millions of acres, shrouded the region in smoke and left at least 27 people dead. But even when confronted by California’s governor and other state officials, the president insisted on attributing the crisis solely to poor forest management, not climate change.Mr. Biden, for his part, assailed Mr. Trump’s record on the climate, asserting that the president’s inaction and denial had fed destruction, citing not just the current emergency on the West Coast but flooding in the Midwest and hurricanes along the Gulf Coast. In an outdoor speech at a museum in Wilmington, Del., the Democratic presidential nominee sought to paint a second Trump term as a danger to the nation’s suburbs, flipping an attack on him by the president.",https://nytimes.com/2020/09/14/us/politics/trump-biden-climate-change-fires.html?searchResultPosition=6,"As Trump Again Rejects Science, Biden Calls Him a ‘Climate Arsonist’

It is unclear whether any of the reports were substantially altered, but important federal health studies have been delayed because of the pressure.The reports are written largely for scientists and public health experts, updating them on trends in all infectious diseases, Covid-19 included.

Hundreds of ballots were mailed after elections were over — meaning they could not be counted — and only a small percentage used the proper tracking procedures, the audit found.With at least three-quarters of American voters eligible to receive a ballot in the mail in 2020 — the most in history — and about 80 million mail ballots expected to flood election offices this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic, the findings raised questions about whether the Postal Service would be able to handle the crush of votes.“While the Postal Service has made progress in preparing for the 2020 general election, there are concerns surrounding integrating stakeholder processes with Postal Service processes to help ensure the timely delivery of election and political mail,” the auditors wrote.",https://nytimes.com/2020/09/01/us/politics/postal-service-late-ballots.html?searchResultPosition=18,"1 Million Primary Ballots Were Mailed Late, Postal Service Watchdog Says

19,Trump Administration Promise to Focus on Extremism Remains Unfulfilled,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security started an effort a year ago this month to address domestic terrorism, white nationalist threats and other acts of homegrown violence, a major shift for an agency created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to protect the country from foreign terrorism.Today the plan to carry out that new mission remains stalled in a bureaucratic morass as clashes between protesters and counterprotesters have escalated to precisely the violent acts that the plan was supposed to address.Instead, a new crop of Department of Homeland Security leaders, led by the confrontational acting secretary, Chad F. Wolf, appear to be doing the opposite of what had been promised. Far from cooperating with local governments and citizens to combat domestic unrest, particularly from the far right, they have joined President Trump in lashing out at American mayors and governors while deploying federal tactical teams to cities — often expressly against the wishes of the local governments with which they had pledged to cooperate.On Monday night on Fox News, Mr. Wolf said he spoke with Attorney General William P.

It has also been accused of using chemical weapons against its own people, as well as the use of cluster bombs and cluster munitions against civilian populations in Yemen and elsewhere. On Monday, President Barack Obama announced that he had ordered a review of how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is conducting its counterterrorism operations in response to terrorist attacks. DHS officials have said that they are working with local law enforcement agencies to identify and investigate potential terrorist threats. But they have not provided details on how they plan to do so.

In a recent article in the American Journal of Sociology, a group of sociologists at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote about the history of racism in American society. The article was titled, ""Racism in America: A History,"" and was published in The American Sociological Review. In the article, the authors write: ""In the United States, as in other parts of the world, there has been a marked increase in racial and ethnic prejudice against blacks and other minorities, and in some cases, against whites."" The authors conclude that ""racial prejudice has become a pervasive feature of American life in recent decades, particularly among young people, who are more likely than other Americans to identify as black, Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific Islander."" In other words, they write, racial prejudice is a ""historical phenomenon"" that can be traced back to the early 20th century. They also note that there is no evidence that racism has changed in any significant way since the 1950s, when the term ""racism"" was first coined. However, it is important to remember that this is not the first time that people have used the terms ""racist"" or ""white supremacist"" to describe people of different races or ethnicities. For example, in an article published by the New York Times in 2005, Richard Spencer, an American neo-Nazi and white supremacist, called for the removal of all white people from the U.S. because of their race or ethnicity. Spencer was also a member of a racist group called the ""alt-right,"" which is an offshoot of white nationalist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP). In an interview with The Daily Stormer, Spencer said that he was ""very proud"" of what he called ""the white supremacists"" and that they ""are the only people who have the courage to stand up and say, 'Enough is enough.' "" He added that his group is ""not racist, but it's not racist to say that we're racist. We're not racists to be honest with you."" Spencer's comments were made in response to a question about whether or not he would be willing to support a bill that would ban the use of racial epithets in public places. ""I'm not going to do that,"" he said. He went on to explain that if he were to vote for it, he wouldn't support it because it would violate his First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of religion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge James Robart on Friday ordered the Justice Department to investigate whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump win the White House, a move that could lead to criminal charges against the former reality TV star and his associates, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said the decision was based on a review of the FBI's investigation into possible coordination between the campaign and Russian officials. ""This is not the first time this has happened,"" the person said, referring to an earlier decision by the Obama administration to shut down an FBI probe into Russian meddling in last year's presidential campaign.

He also said that his administration had been ""very cooperative"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the issue of sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement in hacking the Democratic Party and has accused the United States of interfering in Ukraine's internal affairs.

It also found that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the laws and the Due Process Clause's guarantees of due process and equal access to legal counsel.

And denied a reality in which the virus had faded away the way he said it would in its early days, he created that too, by stage-directing it.Mr. Trump’s 70-minute renomination speech dwelled, for a few minutes here and there, on the pandemic and his administration’s response.

27,The 2020 Party Conventions Gave New Meaning to Political Theater,"The largely virtual format of the Republican and Democratic national conventions meant that even more than usual, the messages were embedded within the visual presentation. Here Vanessa Friedman, the chief fashion critic for The New York Times, and James Poniewozik, the chief television critic, discuss what they saw and what it all meant.VANESSA FRIEDMAN Hi James! So the first mostly virtual party conventions are a wrap. I know the situation was foisted on us all by the pandemic, but it did make for some interesting viewing, and a reframing of the actual events in a way that was — maybe? — more honest about what they actually are.I’ve got to say: The contrast could not have been more graphic by the end. On the one hand, you had the D.N.C., which took place almost entirely remotely, with Zoom panels with “real” (impossible word) voters, and speeches recorded in people’s homes (Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton), schools (Jill Biden), and empty auditoriums (Kamala Harris, Joe Biden). You had some of that with the R.N.C. But Trump’s final speech — live! With audience! At the White House! — completely changed the equation.For me, the first was smaller in scale, more human, and reflected the emptiness and weirdness of the current pandemic age. The second was all about triumphalism, pomp and circumstance. But both were also highly-produced shows, complete with set, soundtrack, costumes and script. My question for you is: Were they the ultimate reality-TV show — sort of a cross between “America’s Got Politics” and “Survivor,” with some “Bachelor” thrown in? Or more like “Masterpiece Theater”?",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/28/arts/television/rnc-dnc-trump.html?searchResultPosition=28,"The 2020 Party Conventions Gave New Meaning to Political Theater

In the wake of the election of Donald Trump as the 45th president, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced that it would not participate in the 2020 presidential election. The DNC's decision was made in response to a request from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), which filed a lawsuit against the DNC for violating the First Amendment rights of its members. According to the ACLU and CMD, ""The DNC is not a party to any political party. It is a non-partisan organization that does not endorse or support any candidate or party."" The DNC has not responded to our request for comment on the decision. However, in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said: ""We are disappointed that the D.C. Democratic Party has decided to withdraw its support for Donald J. Trump. We will continue to work with our elected officials to ensure that our members have the opportunity to elect a president who will uphold the values and principles of our party and our country."" In an interview with TheDCNF, former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile, who is now a CNN contributor, said that she was ""disappointed"" by the announcement. ""I think it's a very sad day for the party,"" she said, adding that ""we're going to have to do everything we can to make sure that we don't lose any of that support."" ""It's sad to see this happen, but I think we need to be very clear about what we're trying to accomplish here,"" said Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (H.G.R. 114). ""There's no question that this election is about the future of this country, and that's why we've decided not to participate,"" he added. In a letter to DNC Chairman Tom Perez, which was sent to him by a member of his staff, Ellison wrote that he ""deeply regrets"" the ""unacceptable"" decision and said he would ""continue to fight for a fair and transparent process for all DNC members."" He added that his office would be ""working closely"" with DNC leadership to ""make sure we have a process in place that is fair, transparent and fair to all members of Congress, including those who are elected to office.""

To make the post-pandemic imagery stick, speaker after speaker — especially the president — had to paint a narrative that rewrote history and was resplendent with distortions, exaggerations and outright falsehoods.From the start of the pandemic, Mr. Trump played down the coronavirus, saying in an interview in January that “we have it totally under control” and speculating in February that it “could maybe go away.” Far from condemning Beijing’s handling of what he would later refer to as the “China virus” or the “Chinese virus,” Mr. Trump initially praised President Xi Jinping’s handling of it.By March 15, as daily cases continued to increase, Mr. Trump said the virus was “something we have tremendous control of.”",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-fact-check.html?searchResultPosition=29,"For Trump, G.O.P.

Trump's ""America First"" agenda is not a new one. In fact, it has been in place for more than a century. It was first proposed by George W. Bush in the early 1990s, and has since been implemented by President Barack Obama. The idea is that the United States should be a ""nation of immigrants,"" and that immigrants should not be treated as second-class citizens, but rather as ""citizens of the world."" In other words, they should have the same rights and privileges as citizens of other countries, including the right to vote, to live and work in their own country, access to health care, education and other basic human rights, as well as the ability to work and pay their fair share of taxes. Trump's plan also calls for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S., and for an end to ""extreme vetting"" of people entering the country from countries with a history of terrorist attacks. These proposals are not new, of course; they have been around for decades. But they are the latest in a long line of proposals that Trump has proposed that have failed to pass muster in Congress, or even in his own party, despite the fact that he has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), both of which he signed into law on January 20, 2017. As the New York Times reports, ""Trump has said he wants to roll back Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who came to this country illegally as children. He has also said that if he were elected president, he would end DACA, a program that allows young people to stay on their parents' health insurance plans for up to six years. And he is also proposing to end the program for people who have committed serious crimes, such as drug dealers and gang members, who could face deportation if convicted of a crime they did not commit."" The Times also notes that ""the administration has repeatedly said it is committed to protecting the rights of all Americans, not just those who come here illegally."" And the Times adds: ""The White House has called on Congress to reject the president's executive order on immigration, saying it violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. 'The president has made it clear he does not want to take any action that would undermine the rule of law,' said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.' The official said the administration had not yet decided how to respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post on whether the order would be rescinded or whether it would continue to apply to people with criminal records or who had committed a serious crime. A senior official familiar with the deliberations told The Post, 'We're not going to make a decision until we have a better understanding of what we're talking about.' 'It's not clear how much of an impact this order will have,' the official added, adding that 'we don't know how many people will be affected by it.' Trump is expected to announce his plan on Friday, according to The Wall Street Journal.",Huggingface

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much for being here today. I want to thank all of you for coming to this event. And we're going to continue to work together to make sure that our country is stronger and more prosperous, and that we have a president who is willing to stand up for what we believe in, who understands the importance of the American people and what it means to be a citizen of this great country. We have to do everything we can to ensure that this president is able to lead this country in the right direction that he believes in. So, thank you, everybody, for taking the time to speak with us today, because I think it's important that you all know that I'm very proud of what you've done for the United States of America and I look forward to working with you and with the rest of our nation to build a better America for all Americans, including those of us who are working hard every day to get our economy back on track, to bring jobs back to our communities and to keep our borders secure. But I also want you to know, as I've said before, this is not just about me. This is about you. It's about the country we live in and the people we care about. You know what I mean? We're not going anywhere. The economy is strong, the middle class is growing, we've got a lot of good things going for us, but we don't have the kind of prosperity we need right now. That's why I am here tonight to talk about what's going on in Washington, D.C., and how I can make it better for our children and our grandchildren. Let me start by saying that my father was a great man. He worked hard, he loved his country and he did everything in his power to help it grow and prosper. When I was growing up in New York City, my dad was the mayor of that city. Now, I grew up here in a small town, so I know how hard it can be to grow up and get a job. My dad always said, ""If you can't work hard enough, you'll never get the chance to go to college."" And that's exactly what happened to me when I got out of high school and went to the University of California, Berkeley, where I majored in business administration. As a business student, it was very hard to find a good job because you couldn't afford to pay for it. In fact, if you wanted to stay in school, there was no way you could afford a college education. If you didn't get your degree, then you'd be stuck in debt for a long time and you wouldn't make enough money to buy a house or a car or anything like that. There were so many things that went wrong with my life that made me feel like I had to take care of my family and my friends and go out and do whatever it took to earn a decent living and make a living for myself, which is what my parents did for me in my early 20s and early 30s. They gave me everything I needed to live a normal life and then they took away my education and put me into a private school that was really, really bad for my future and made it even worse than it should have been. Then, when my mom got sick, she took me to see a doctor and told me that if I could get my doctor's permission to have an abortion, that it would be the only way to save my mother's life. She also said that she would never let me have another abortion because she thought I would die of a heart attack or some other horrible thing. Well, what she did was she gave us the option of not having a second opinion and she told us that even if we did have one, our doctor would not let us have it because he thought that would make us more likely to end up with a life of pain and suffering and death because we would have no choice but to terminate our pregnancy. What she said was that, even though we had the choice of abortion or not, her decision to give us this option was not based on any moral or religious belief or belief system. Her decision was based solely on her own personal beliefs and not on the beliefs of anyone else in her family or her friends or any other person who was in any way affiliated with any religion or political party or group or organization that supported abortion rights, or who supported any form of discrimination against women or people of color or anyone who has been discriminated against because of their race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, marital status, physical or mental handicap, mental illness, veteran status or other protected status.",Huggingface
30,"Instead of Evolving as President, Trump Has Bent the Job to His Will","WASHINGTON — For a man on the edge of history, President Trump sounded calm and relaxed. If he believes that he is on the verge of losing, he betrayed no sign of it. Instead, he trotted out one of his favorite polls, boasted about his popularity with Republican voters and talked about his convention’s television ratings.His presidency, he declared in an interview this week, has produced “an incredible result.” The stock markets are “pretty amazing,” the Republican National Convention has been “very successful,” and he has “done a very good job” of handling the coronavirus pandemic even though more than 180,000 Americans are dead. At the same time, he said, he has endured “terrible things” by his “maniac” opponents.After nearly four years in office, Mr. Trump heads into the fall campaign with a striking blend of braggadocio and grievance, a man of extremes who claims one moment to have accomplished more than virtually any other president even as he complains moments later that he has also suffered more than any of them. He inhabits a world of his own making, sometimes untethered from the reality recognized by others. He has imposed his will on Washington and the world like no one else.While previous presidents evolved in office as they learned the mechanisms of power and adjusted their goals by the time they claimed renomination, Mr. Trump remains the same polarizing, dominating force of nature who got up four years ago and asserted that “I alone can fix it.” He has not tempered with age nor bent to convention nor been chastened by impeachment. He says he still considers himself “an outsider” even while occupying the highest office in the land.",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/politics/donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=31,"Instead of Evolving as President, Trump Has Bent the Job to His Will to Make America Great Again.

This is not the first time Trump has tried to make America great again. During his campaign, he promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he later said would cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years. He also said he would cut taxes for the middle class by $500 billion over the next decade. And in his first 100 days in office, the president has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada, Mexico, and the United States, a move that has been met with opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike. In fact, during his time in the White House, President Barack Obama signed NAFTA into law in 2009, but it was never ratified by Congress. Trump's plan for renegotiating NAFTA, however, is far from the only one he has attempted to do so. The president also has made it clear that he will not be willing to negotiate with Mexico on a trade deal with the European Union (EU), which is the largest trading partner of the two countries. As a result, it is likely that the Trump administration will continue to push for NAFTA to be renegotiated by the end of this year, even if it does not pass the House of Representatives. It is also unlikely that Trump will be able to convince Congress to pass a bill that would allow him to keep his promises to the American people, as he did during the campaign. Instead, his plan will likely be to use his executive power to force Congress into a vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a controversial trade agreement that is expected to cost billions of dollars in lost jobs and millions of American jobs. This would be a major blow to American workers, who have been struggling for years to pay their fair share of taxes and pay for their education, health care, food, housing, education and other basic needs. While the TPP is an important step forward for American manufacturing, there is still a long way to go before it can be fully implemented. Even if Congress passes the bill, Congress would still have to approve it before the deal can go to President Trump for final approval. If Congress doesn't pass it, then Trump could be forced to sign an executive order that could force the government to stop doing business with foreign countries that do not want to participate in TPP negotiations, such as China, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Taiwan, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Mauritania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Swaziland, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Western Sahara, Zaire, West Bank and parts of Central African Republic.",Huggingface

Speech

Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, delivered a speech at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Tuesday night. The speech was part of a three-day tour of the U.S. Capitol, including a visit to the White House, where he spoke at length about his views on abortion, gay marriage, and the Supreme Court. He also spoke about the role of religion in American politics, as well as his plans for the future of his family. Here's what he had to say:


Q: What do you think is the most important issue facing the country right now? What is your vision for America and what is it that we need to do to make sure that the American people have access to health care, education, jobs, security, opportunity and opportunity for all of our citizens? And what does that mean for your family and for our country as a whole? I think it's important for us to be able to move forward in a way that is consistent with what we've been doing for many, many years. And that's why I'm here today. I want to talk about a lot of things. First of all, I would like to start by saying that I believe in the right of every American to have an equal opportunity to succeed in this country. That means that if you're born into a family of immigrants, you have a right to a fair shot at a decent job, a chance to go to college, to get a good job and a job that pays well, that you can go out and do whatever you want. But I also believe that all Americans should have the same opportunity as any other American. So, if we're going to build a country that works for everyone, we have to give everybody the opportunity that they deserve. We've got to take care of each other, not just the rich and powerful, but also the poor and middle class and people of color, people with disabilities and those who are in need of help. If we don't do that, there will be no place for people like you and me to live and work. It's time to end the war on drugs, stop the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and all the other wars that have been going on for too long and we should not allow that to happen again. This is not a time for war, this is an era of peace and prosperity. There's no reason why we shouldn't have more of these things happening in our communities and around the world. As I've said many times before, America is a land of opportunity, prosperity and security. Our country is built on a foundation of equality, justice and respect for every human being, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, national origin, age, disability, or any of those other factors that make us a great place to work, live, work and play. In this day and age of mass surveillance, mass incarceration and other forms of abuse of power, it is our responsibility as citizens to ensure that our government does not abuse our civil liberties, our democracy, its ability to protect the rights of its citizens and to uphold the rule of law. To that end, my administration is committed to working with our allies in Congress and across the political spectrum to pass comprehensive immigration reform that will make it easier for illegal immigrants to enter the United States, strengthen our border security and protect our nation's borders from terrorist attacks, protect American workers and American families from the threat of terrorism, create a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants who come here illegally as children and as adults, provide legal permanent resident status for thousands of young people who have never been here before and will not be eligible for a green card or a driver's license because they have not been convicted of any crime. These are just a few of my priorities for this administration and I will continue to pursue them as they become more and more important to our national security interests. Thank you, Mr. President, for being here with me.",Huggingface

Trump's first 100 days in office will be his first as president, according to a new report from The New York Times. The Times reports that Trump is expected to announce his administration's plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act by the end of the year. Trump has said he wants to replace Obamacare with a single-payer health care system, which he has called ""Obamacare for America."" The plan would provide health insurance to all Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions, but it would not cover people with preexisting conditions such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS. It would also require insurers to cover the cost of care for people who don't qualify for Medicaid, the federal government's health coverage program for the poor and disabled. In addition, Trump would eliminate the individual mandate that requires people to buy insurance on their own or through a third-party health plan. He also would repeal Obamacare's requirement that employers offer health plans to their employees, a move that critics say would make it harder for low- and middle-income workers to get health-care coverage. ""It's going to be a disaster for our country,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, in an interview with The Washington Post. Sanders, who is running for president in 2016, called the plan a ""disaster"" for working people and called it ""the worst thing that's ever happened to the American economy."" ""This is not the first time that we've had a president who's been in this position for a long time,"" Sanders told The Post, adding, ""I think it's time for him to step back and take a look at what he's done and what we need to do to make sure that this is the right thing for this country."" Sanders also said that he was ""very concerned"" about the lack of progress made by Republicans in Congress on repealing and replacing Obamacare, noting that the House passed a bill earlier this year that would have repealed the law and replaced it with an alternative plan, known as the ""skinny repeal"" bill. But the bill failed to pass in both chambers of Congress, leaving Republicans with little chance of passing a replacement plan that includes the repeal of Obamacare. Republicans have said they will not allow a repeal-and-replace bill to take effect until after the November election, when the party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, is sworn into office. Democrats have called on Trump to release his tax returns before the Nov. 8 election.",Huggingface

Is Trump Violating It at the R.N.C.?,"No modern president has accepted his party’s nomination for re-election from the White House.But amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced a near-total reimagining of how to carry out a presidential campaign, President Trump plans to do just that on Thursday, when he will deliver his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention from the South Lawn of the White House.The speech is expected to be the last of several repeated violations over the course of the convention of the Hatch Act, a Depression-era law devised to ensure that the federal work force operates free of political influence or coercion.Here is what you need to know about the Hatch Act and why it has drawn so much attention during the Republican National Convention.The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities while they are working in an official capacity. Named for former Senator Carl A. Hatch, Democrat of New Mexico, the law has been on the books for 81 years.",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/hatch-act-trump-rnc.html?searchResultPosition=35,"What Is the Hatch Act? Is Trump Violating It at the R.N.C.?

Hatch Act is a bill that was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), who is the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It was sponsored by Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on January 20, 2017. The bill is known as the H.R. 3261, which is an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would make it illegal for a federal agency to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, or any other protected class of protected classes. This bill would also prohibit the federal government from discriminating against individuals based on their race or color. In addition, it would require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct background checks on all applicants for federal employment, including those who have been convicted of a crime, as well as on those with criminal records. Under the bill, the government would not be able to deny an individual a job if they are found to have a criminal record, but would be required to do so only if the individual has been adjudicated to be a ""high risk"" or ""low risk,"" and has a history of mental illness or substance abuse problems. As a result, a person with a high risk or low risk of committing a violent crime could be denied entry into the United States without a court order, even though the person is not a threat to public safety or the safety of others. However, this bill does not prohibit federal agencies from denying entry to individuals with mental health problems, such as those on probation or parole, for reasons other than those listed in this section.

36,Border Officials Weighed Deploying Migrant ‘Heat Ray’ Ahead of Midterms,"WASHINGTON — Fifteen days before the 2018 midterm elections, as President Trump sought to motivate Republicans with dark warnings about caravans heading to the U.S. border, he gathered his homeland security secretary and White House staff to deliver a message: “extreme action” was needed to stop the migrants.That afternoon, at a separate meeting with top leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection officials suggested deploying a microwave weapon — a “heat ray” designed by the military to make people’s skin feel as if it is burning when they get within range of its invisible beams.Developed by the military as a crowd dispersal tool two decades ago, the Active Denial System had been largely abandoned amid doubts over its effectiveness and morality. Two former officials who attended the afternoon meeting at the Department of Homeland Security on Oct. 22, 2018, said the suggestion that the device be installed at the border shocked attendees, even if it would have satisfied the president.Kirstjen Nielsen, then the secretary of homeland security, told an aide after the meeting that she would not authorize the use of such a device, and that it should never be brought up again in her presence, the officials said.",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/trump-campaign-immigration.html?searchResultPosition=37,"Border Officials Weighed Deploying Migrant ‘Heat Ray’ Ahead of Midterms

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today announced that it has launched an investigation into allegations of voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election. The investigation is being led by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The OIG will conduct an independent review of allegations that have been made against the election process, including whether there was a concerted effort to undermine the integrity of voting in order to disenfranchise eligible voters. In addition, the investigation will focus on whether any efforts were made to influence the outcome of this election by foreign actors, such as the Russian government, or by individuals or groups that are not American citizens.

It came shortly before the fifth anniversary of the high court’s landmark ruling on marriage equality.

Thousands marched in Brooklyn, N.Y., in support of Black transgender lives.President Trump was almost entirely silent through it all.There was no tweet in honor of Pride Month, despite suggestions from several aides to Mr. Trump that he write one.

That includes bipartisan legislation he signed in 2018 that made substantial changes to federal prison and sentencing laws.“We believe that each person is made by God for a purpose,” Mr. Trump said in the video. “I will continue to give all Americans, including former inmates, the best chance to build a new life and achieve their own American dream, and a great American dream it is.”",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/25/us/politics/trump-jon-ponder-pardon.html?searchResultPosition=41,"Trump Pardons Jon Ponder, a Convicted Bank Robber

Biden Jr. was elected to the White House and if Democrats won sweeping victories in Congress. Mr. Scott and Ms. Haley, two Republicans who are rumored to be eyeing a 2024 presidential run, sought to weave their jabs at liberals with a more traditional message of inspiration and small government.Tuesday night’s lineup features an eclectic blend of speakers, including three members of Mr. Trump’s immediate family. The message will most likely tread similar ground: that November’s election is a crossroads for the country, and that re-electing President Trump is a moral necessity.The first lady, Melania Trump, will anchor the evening, and two of the president’s adult children — Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump — will also speak.",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/25/us/politics/republican-national-convention-guide.html?searchResultPosition=42,"What to Watch for on Day 2 of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.

42,Trump Leverages Powers of Office as He Seeks to Broaden Appeal ,"President Trump made a bid to sand down his divisive political image by appropriating the resources of his office and the powers of the presidency at the Republican convention on Tuesday, breaching the traditional boundaries between campaigning and governing in an effort to broaden his appeal beyond his conservative base.In an abrupt swerve from the dire tone of the convention’s first night, Mr. Trump staged a grab-bag of gauzy events and personal testimonials aimed in particular at female and minority voters. In videos recorded at the White House, Mr. Trump pardoned a Nevada man convicted of bank robbery and swore in five new American citizens, all of them people of color, in a miniature naturalization ceremony.Where the convention on Monday emphasized predictions of social and economic desolation under a government led by Democrats, the second night speakers — including three from Mr. Trump’s immediate family — hailed the president as a friend to women and a champion of criminal justice reform. There was no effort to reconcile the dissonance between the two nights’ programs, particularly the shift from Monday’s rhetoric about a looming “vengeful mob” of dangerous criminals into Tuesday’s tributes to the power of personal redemption.It was not clear whether this new appeal would change the minds of women, people of color and others who had formed negative opinions of Mr. Trump over the past five years, amid the allegations of sexual assault against him, the appeals to racial bigotry and hard-line policies like a border crackdown that separated migrant families.",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/republican-convention-recap.html?searchResultPosition=43,"Trump Leverages Powers of Office as He Seeks to Broaden Appeal 

43,The Impeachment Battle Rematch That Wasn’t,"WASHINGTON — In all the hours and hours of speeches at last week’s Democratic National Convention and the first two nights of the Republican National Convention, one word was almost entirely missing: impeachment.Just six months after President Trump’s trial on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, what was seen as the titanic battle of a generation has essentially vanished from the political landscape as if it had never happened. Although both sides had once anticipated taking the dispute to the voters, they have instead quietly dropped the matter and moved on.The case of the disappearing impeachment testifies to how drastically American politics have shifted in such a short time. Instead of focusing on whether Mr. Trump abused his power by seeking foreign help to win an election or Democrats abused their power by impeaching him for it, the national conversation is dominated by issues that were barely on the radar screen when the trial ended in February — a pandemic that has killed more than 175,000 Americans, the resulting economic collapse and questions of racial injustice and law and order.“Voters literally didn’t care about and forgot about impeachment the day after the vote,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “Democrats favored it but didn’t think it would accomplish anything” because Senate Republicans would never vote to convict him. Less partisan Americans, she added, “didn’t really understand why he was being impeached, and Republicans thought it was a ‘witch hunt.’”",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/25/us/politics/trump-impeachment-convention.html?searchResultPosition=44,"The Impeachment Battle Rematch That Wasn’t a Good Idea

It's been a long time since I've written a post about the impeachment of President Trump, but I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on it. I think it's important to point out that this is not the first time Trump has been impeached by the House of Representatives. In fact, it was the last time he was removed from office by a Republican-controlled House. And while I'm sure there are plenty of people who would disagree with me on this point, I don't think impeachment is a bad idea. It's just that it doesn't always work out the way you want it to, especially when you're dealing with a president who has a history of abusing the power of the presidency. So let's take a look at what we've seen so far, and see if we can get a better idea of what's going on here. First of all, let me say that I am not saying that impeachment isn't a good idea, or at least not in this case. But I do think that there's a lot of work to be done to get to the bottom of this and to make sure that the president is held accountable for his actions and that he's held to account for the actions of his administration. That's something that we're going to have to do in the coming weeks and months, as we continue to work with Congress and the American people to ensure that our president and his team are held responsible for their actions, not just for what they've done but for how they're doing them. We've got to keep in mind, though, that even if there is some kind of impeachment, there will always be some sort of obstruction of justice. There are a number of things that can go wrong with an impeachment process. One of those things is that you can't just say, ""Well, you know what, we need to impeach this president,"" because that's not what the Constitution is about. The Constitution says that Congress shall have power to remove an impeachable offense from the office of president. If the President is found guilty of a crime, he or she has the right to seek a new trial or to appeal the conviction to a federal district court, which is the federal court that has jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings. This means that if you have a conviction for a felony or a misdemeanor, the court can order you to pay a fine of not more than $100,000, a term of imprisonment of up to one year or both. You can also file a motion to dismiss a charge of contempt of court or any other civil or criminal proceeding. All of these things can happen in a matter of days or weeks, depending on the circumstances of your case and what you've been accused of doing or not doing. As I said in my previous post, impeachment can be a very difficult process, because it can take months or even years for an individual to come to terms with his or her own actions or lack of actions. However, if the charges are brought against you by someone else, then you'll have the opportunity to bring them to trial and try to find out what happened to you or your family, your friends, family members, friends of friends and relatives, etc. Once you do that, all of that will be taken care of by an independent prosecutor, who will then decide whether to charge you with any criminal offenses or whether you should be tried as an adult or as a juvenile. A good prosecutor will also be able to try you for other offenses, such as perjury, obstruction, lying to an FBI agent, false statements, conspiracy to commit perjury and other charges that could lead to jail time or prison time for you. These charges can range from misdemeanors to felonies, so you won't be charged with every single one of them, even though you may have been involved in some serious crimes in your life, like driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, for example. Also, in many cases, these charges will not be considered a criminal offense in any way, shape or form. Instead, they'll be used as evidence to prove your guilt or innocence, to show that your actions were not a violation of federal law or the law of any state or local government, including the United States Supreme Court. For example, when a person is convicted of an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for life or life without the possibility of parole or parole for 30 years or more, their sentence is commuted to life in prison without parole, rather than the 30-year sentence that would be imposed if they had been sentenced to prison for that same offense. When you are found not guilty by reason of insanity or insanity-defying conduct, however, by virtue of having committed a lesser-than-life offense, this sentence may be reduced to death by lethal injection and/or life imprisonment, whichever is more appropriate.",Huggingface
44,Republicans Turn to Rescued Hostages to Highlight Trump Foreign Policy,"With President Trump largely stymied in his efforts to achieve landmark foreign policy victories like a nuclear deal with North Korea or an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, the start of the Republican National Convention spotlighted his record in a narrow category: the release of Americans detained overseas.In an unusual video segment that aired on Monday and was pretaped by the Trump campaign’s advertising firm, Jamestown Associates, the president met at the White House with six Americans whom his administration helped to free from foreign imprisonment. Rather than dwelling on their ordeals, most of them lavished praise on Mr. Trump.The event underscored the transactional approach to foreign policy of a president who has shown little patience for abstract ideals like alliances and stability and appears motivated instead by tangible results like arms sales and concessions like the release of imprisoned Americans. It also left some security experts concerned that the president’s focus on hostage cases might inspire foreign adversaries to capture more Americans.The presentation was all the more notable given Mr. Trump’s praise for Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, during an exchange with the Rev.

46,"With Nothing Else Working, Trump Races to Make a New Supreme Court Justice the Issue","WASHINGTON — When news broke on Friday that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had died, President Trump was just five minutes into a campaign rally in Minnesota and aides opted not to pass word to him onstage.

But for Mr. Trump, nothing else has been working and so he has propelled himself, his Republican allies and the country into a breakneck race to confirm a successor to Justice Ginsburg before the Nov. 3 election, bulldozing past the precedent his own party set four years ago in a gamble that the political payoff will outweigh any political cost.Even as he presses ahead, Republicans remain uncertain whether it would be better to hold a confirmation vote before the election or announce the nomination and start hearings but leave the final decision until a lame-duck session afterward. If they act before the election, they may lock in a conservative majority on the court for years.

That has fueled concerns about whether the service will be able to handle what is expected to be a record number of mail-in ballots for the 2020 election.Mr. DeJoy, at times shouting over his Democratic questioners, criticized the “false narrative” that he said was being promoted about both his intentions and the changes, which he described as necessary to address the Postal Service’s financial woes but that civil rights groups, state attorneys general and Democrats have derided as an attempt to disenfranchise voters.",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/24/us/politics/postal-service-dejoy-testimony.html?searchResultPosition=50,"Key Highlights of Louis DeJoy’s Testimony to a House Panel‬

Yet there was Stephen K. Bannon, the mastermind of the 2016 election, with his hair now long and scraggly and his face weathered, marched into court and called a crook.That was only part of the president’s tough week or so.

It was July 1988 and Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate for president, was on a roll after his party’s convention in Atlanta. A Gallup poll showed Mr. Bush trailing by 17 points.But he had a road map to victory.One month earlier, Mr. Bush’s top aides had gathered at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, deliberately out of sight and away from campaign headquarters, to review a thick binder of polling and focus group data. The campaign’s research showed that Mr. Dukakis’s record was not well known and that some of his liberal positions, in particular supporting prison furloughs and opposing the death penalty, could swamp him in a general election.Using the plan laid out in that room, the Bush campaign proceeded, as Lee Atwater, the campaign manager, put it, “to strip the bark off the little bastard,” beginning in force with Mr. Bush’s hammer of a speech at the Republican National Convention in August through Election Day.Mr. Bush not only overcame Mr. Dukakis’s summer polling advantage, but defeated him handily: by 53 percent to 46 percent.

In the wake of the election of Donald J. Trump as the Republican nominee for president, there has been a lot of talk about the possibility of a return to the days of Bush and Bush II, when the two men were in the White House together. But there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case. In fact, it is quite possible that the Bush years were marked by a period in which both men became more and more comfortable with each other, and both were able to work together on issues that were important to both of them, such as foreign policy and national security. This is not to say that there was never a moment when Bush was more or less in agreement with Trump, or that he was not willing to back down from his positions on many issues. It is simply to point out that, in many ways, Trump is a different kind of president than Bush. He is more pragmatic, more open-minded, less confrontational. And, of course, he does not have the temperament to be commander-in-chief, but he has the ability to make decisions that are in his best interest. That is what makes him a better commander in chief than any other president in American history.",Huggingface

WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), are expected to announce their presidential bids on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement was made by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, the person said, and Sanders campaign manager Robby Mook did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Clinton's campaign declined to comment on the details of the announcement, but a spokeswoman for Sanders said the Vermont senator would announce his presidential bid ""as soon as possible"" if he is elected president in November. Sanders has said he will not seek re-election in 2016, though he has not said whether he plans to run for president again in the 2016 election cycle. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday, Clinton said she would not run again for the White House if she were elected.

 (Reuters) — Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former secretary of state and U.S. senator from New York, will announce her presidential candidacy on Friday, her campaign announced on its website. She will be accompanied by her husband, former President Bill Clinton (D-N.Y.), and their two children, Chelsea and Sasha, as well as former First Lady Michelle Obama and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is running as a third-party candidate. Her campaign also released a statement saying it was ""deeply saddened"" by the news. ""It is with great sadness that I announce my candidacy for President of The United States of America,"" the statement read, adding, ""We will continue to work together to make America great again. We will work hard to ensure that every American has the opportunity to succeed in this great country."" The statement also said that Clinton would be the first woman to serve as president of a major political party in modern American history and that she ""will be a strong advocate for women's rights and equal rights for all Americans."" Clinton has been a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's health care law, which she has called a ""disaster"" for millions of Americans. Obama has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a single-payer system that would provide health insurance to everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions. But Clinton also has criticized the Obama administration's approach to the issue, calling it ""unworkable"" and ""out of touch with reality."" She has also called for a ban on Muslim immigration from the country, saying that ""we have to do something about it."" In a speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday, she called the Muslim ban ""the worst thing that has ever happened to our country,"" and said it would ""destroy our economy and our way of life."" Sanders, meanwhile, has repeatedly criticized Clinton for her record on foreign policy and criticized her handling of classified information during her time as Secretary of State. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Sanders called on Clinton to release more information about her private email server as part of an effort to combat terrorism. He said Clinton should release her transcripts of speeches she gave to Wall Street banks and other financial institutions in order to ""show the world that we are not afraid to stand up for what we believe in.""",Huggingface
54,7 Takeaways From the Democratic National Convention,"WILMINGTON, Del. — After nearly five decades in national politics and in his third run at the presidency, Joseph R. Biden Jr. accepted his party’s nomination on Thursday with one of the most forceful speeches of his career — given to a dark and empty room here, save for a smattering of journalists who watched him live as he addressed the nation by camera.It was a final, surreal scene in an extraordinary virtual Democratic convention week that showcased a party unified around Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris — even as sharp differences remain below the surface.Here are seven key takeaways from an unprecedented gathering:",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/politics/dnc-takeaways-biden-obama.html?searchResultPosition=55,"7 Takeaways From the Democratic National Convention:

1. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Clinton's margin of victory over Trump was larger than that of any other candidate in history, and it was the largest margin for any candidate to win the presidency in modern history. Trump won by more than 50,000 votes, while Clinton lost by less than 10,500 votes. In other words, the Electoral College is the most important factor in determining the outcome of the election, not the candidate who won it. It is important to note, however, that the electoral college is not a ""winner-take-all"" system. Rather, it is a set of rules that determine who gets to be president and who doesn't. The rules are set by the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, but they are not set in stone. As a result, there is no guarantee that a candidate will be elected to the office of president. However, if a person is elected president, he or she will have the same rights and responsibilities as the rest of us, including the right to vote. This means that if you are a Democrat or a Republican, you will not be able to run for president in 2016. You will still be eligible to serve as a member of Congress, as long as you meet the requirements of your state's electoral law. If you do not meet these requirements, then you may not serve in Congress for a period of up to six years, or until you become eligible for re-election to Congress in 2018, whichever comes first.

I don't think there's ever been a time in our history where we've been able to say, 'Well, we're not going to talk about this anymore.' "" That's why I'm so excited to be here with you today. And I want to thank you for being with us. It's been an honor and a privilege to meet you. Thank you so much for your time and the opportunity you've given me to speak at this conference. You've done a great job. We're very proud of you and we look forward to seeing you at the conference next year. But first, I'd like to ask you a few questions. First of all, what do you do for a living? What does it take to get a job? Do you have kids? Are you married? Have you ever had a child? And, of course, if you're married, how many children have you had? I mean, you know, there are a lot of things that you can do to make a difference in your life, but you also have to take care of your family, your friends and your kids. So, for example, when I was growing up, my mom was a nurse and my dad was an electrician, so I had to go to college. My dad worked as a janitor at a grocery store and his wife worked in a construction company and so on. When I got to the point where I didn't have enough money to pay for my own college education, it was very difficult for me because I couldn't afford to buy a car or a house or anything like that. The only thing that I could do was go out and buy my first car and then I would go back to school and get my degree. That was the only way I knew how to live my life and that was what I did. Now, as I look back on it now, that wasn't the case at all. As I looked back at it today, those are the things I've learned about myself and what it takes to become a better human being. What I learned is that there is no such thing as the perfect person. There is only one person in this world who has the ability to achieve what he or she wants to accomplish and it is you who is the one who can make that happen for yourself and for the rest of the people around you, whether you like it or not. This is what makes us human beings, this is why we are human. If we can't do that, then we will never be human again. ""That's the thing about being human,"" I said, ""is that we all have the capacity to change our lives and change the lives of others. In order for that to happen, people must be willing to accept that change and accept the fact that they are not the same person as they were before they became human."" And that is exactly what happened to me. Because of that experience, many of us have come to realize that the way we live is not just a matter of how much money we have or what kind of work we do or who we work with. Our lives are all about how we treat others, our families and our friends, all of which are important things to us and to our children and their children's children. All of these things are part of our human nature and they're important for us to recognize and recognize that our relationship with others is one of love and kindness and compassion and respect and understanding and being kind and caring and loving and compassionate and kind. Those are just the basic elements of being a good, kind, caring, loving, compassionate person, a person who cares deeply about others and cares about himself and about his or her own well-being and needs and wants and desires and wishes and hopes and dreams and aspirations and goals and ambitions and expectations and fears and anxieties and disappointments and failures and successes and setbacks and triumphs and defeats and victories and achievements and accomplishments and successes and tragedies and disasters and catastrophes and calamities and great and small and terrible and wonderful and beautiful and good and bad and ugly and evil and suffering and sorrow and joy and pain and pleasure and peace and happiness and bliss and beauty and goodness and wisdom and virtue and truth and justice and reason and right and wrong and injustice and ignorance and falsehood and deception and fraud and deceit and lying and deceiving and misleading and false-flag propaganda and lies and distortions and misrepresentations and misstatements and exaggerations of facts and of fact and",Huggingface

Evoking American ancestors persecuted because of their race, religion or nationality, he said they had every reason to give up on democracy but did not.In his telling, that is what is at stake at this hinge point in history, nothing less than the future of democracy, and he seemed emotional in a way that the famously stoic former president rarely allows himself to be in public. He talked of “dark times” and “hardship and injustice” and “the meanness and the lies and crazy conspiracy theories.” He declared that this year’s election will determine whether America lives up to its promise.His excoriation of his successor was withering. The incumbent president, he charged, is lazy, uncaring and interested only in drawing attention to himself. President Trump, Mr. Obama said, acts as if he is “above the law,” uses his office “to enrich” himself and his allies, exploits the military “as political props” to be deployed against peaceful protesters, demonizes his opponents and the free press, and disregards science during a deadly pandemic in favor of “just making stuff up.” What’s more, he added, Mr. Trump is trying to suppress the vote to stay in office.The 19-minute address, delivered in front of an exhibit titled “Writing the Constitution” at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, reflected a long journey from the hope and change of 2008 when Mr. Obama sailed into the White House on a fundamentally optimistic message that whatever the country’s problems, they could be solved by coming together.

WASHINGTON — The Democratic National Committee is expected to announce on Tuesday that it will no longer support Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, a move that could be seen as a major blow to the party's hopes of winning back the White House in November. The move comes after the DNC announced it would not support the former secretary of state's bid for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2016 election, which is set to take place on Nov. 8 in Philadelphia and New York City, according to people familiar with the matter. ""The DNC will continue to support Mrs. Clinton for President of the United States,"" DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement released by her campaign on Monday afternoon. Wasserman said the decision was made after consulting with party officials, who said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by what they saw as an ""unacceptable"" decision by DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile to not endorse Clinton. In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, DNC Chairman Tom Perez said he was ""disappointed"" and ""shocked"" to hear about the move. He added, ""I'm not going to comment on the specifics of this decision, but I will say that I am deeply disappointed and disappointed that this is happening."" The announcement comes just days before the first Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas, where Clinton will face Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. On Monday night, Clinton was scheduled to speak at a rally in New Hampshire. But she canceled the event, saying it was too late to make up her mind about whether she would run again. A DNC spokesman said that the organization would ""continue to work with our campaign to ensure that we have the best chance to win the nomination and that there is a clear path forward for Hillary to become the next president."" ""We are committed to building a strong and vibrant Democratic Party for all Americans, and we look forward to working with Hillary and her team to build on this momentum,"" the spokesman added.

The decision to cancel the debate comes as the Clinton campaign continues to push for a contested convention that would be held in July, in which the candidate would face off against Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is running against Trump. Trump has called Clinton a ""liar"" who should be disqualified from the presidency, while Clinton has accused her of being too cozy with Wall Street and the financial industry. She has also called for an investigation into her use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State and has said she has no plans to run for re-election in 2016. Sanders, the Vermont independent, has been a vocal critic of Clinton over her handling of classified information, calling her ""extremely careless"" in handling it and calling for her to be impeached.",Huggingface

Not only did the effort require creating technological solutions for decades-old processes — like drafting the party’s platform — but also soothing the frayed nerves of hundreds of delegates, dozens of V.I.P.s and the entire city of Milwaukee, which had already poured millions into the event.I talked to Mr. Perez about what we can expect to see when the convention begins next week. Next week, we’ll hear from Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, about what her party has planned. (As usual, this interview has been condensed and edited.)There has never been an online convention. What should we expect next week? Glitchy Zoom calls? Surprise celebrity guests?

78,Kamala Harris Crystallizes Trump’s View of Women: They’re ‘Nasty’ or Housewives,"WASHINGTON — In the hours since Senator Kamala Harris joined the Democratic presidential ticket, President Trump has responded by sorting women into two categories: the good “suburban housewife” he believes will vote for him, and nasty women who have not shown him or his political allies a sufficient amount of respect.After Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, announced on Tuesday that Ms. Harris would be his running mate, Mr. Trump wasted no time sorting her into the “nasty” camp, a category occupied by the last woman to run against him on a Democratic ticket.“She was extraordinarily nasty to Brett Kavanaugh — Judge Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Harris, using “nasty” or some version of the word no fewer than four times as he referred to Senate confirmation hearings held in 2018. At the time, Mr. Kavanaugh, angrily seeking to rebut emotional testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, a professor who accused him of sexually assaulting her at a party in 1982, found himself on the receiving end of questions from Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor.",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/12/us/politics/trump-women-kamala-harris.html?searchResultPosition=85,"Kamala Harris Crystallizes Trump’s View of Women: They’re ‘Nasty’ or Housewives?

79,Can Neil Young Block Trump From Using His Songs? It’s Complicated,"On Election Day in 2018, Neil Young posted a frustrated statement about President Trump.Three years earlier, Mr. Trump had used Mr. Young’s song “Rockin’ in the Free World” — a protest against injustice — when announcing his campaign, drawing Mr. Young’s ire. With the divisive midterms underway, Mr. Young once again complained, yet said he had no legal recourse to stop Mr. Trump from using his music.“Legally, he has the right to,” Mr. Young wrote on his website, “however it goes against my wishes.”Last week, Mr. Young finally sued Mr. Trump’s campaign over the use of “Rockin’ in the Free World” and another song, “Devil’s Sidewalk,” both of which were played at Mr. Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Okla., in June. In his suit, the musician accused the campaign of copyright infringement for playing the tracks without a license, and asked for the campaign to be ordered to stop using them, as well as for statutory damages.Mr. Young’s complaint said he “in good conscience cannot allow his music to be used as a ‘theme song’ for a divisive, un-American campaign of ignorance and hate.”",https://nytimes.com/2020/08/12/arts/music/neil-young-donald-trump-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=86,"Can Neil Young Block Trump From Using His Songs?

Biden Jr., accusing her of publicly criticizing the administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic because she is disgruntled over being fired.Keith Kellogg, the retired lieutenant general who is national security adviser to Mr. Pence, told reporters that he had recommended removing the aide, Olivia Troye, from her position as the vice president’s top Homeland Security adviser in charge of managing the coronavirus task force.“The reason I fired her was her performances started to drop after six months working on the task force,” Mr. Kellogg said, calling Ms. Troye a “backbencher” in the administration’s efforts to combat the pandemic.“She was responsible for coordinating meetings, bringing people together. And when the performance level dropped off,” he said, he went to Mr. Pence “and recommended she leave.

Obama said the attacks were a ""horrific attack"" and called on Congress to take action. The president also said he had spoken with President-elect Donald Trump about the investigation, and urged him to act quickly to bring it to a close. Biden called Trump's comments ""outrageous,"" and said that the president had ""no choice but to condemn this despicable act."" ""This is not the first time this has happened in our nation's capital,"" he said, adding that ""we must do everything we can to prevent this from happening again in the future.""

81,Democratic Donors Push Biden for a Cabinet Free of Fossil Fuel Connections,"WASHINGTON — Liberal activists have opened a new front in their battle to push Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the left on climate change: a campaign to pressure the Democratic presidential nominee to reject advisers with any ties to fossil fuel companies.The targets include former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and others who served in the Obama administration.Last week more than 60 deep-pocketed donors asked Mr. Biden to commit to a moratorium on all new coal, oil and natural gas development — and to select advisers who are “free from fossil fuel influence.” The group, which includes Kathy Washienko, a clean-energy investor in Seattle; Robin Chase, a co-founder and former chief executive of Zipcar; and Adelaide Park Gomer, the president of the Park Foundation philanthropic group and a longtime anti-fracking activist, implored Mr. Biden to “choose new, bolder leadership” than those with whom he worked under President Barack Obama.“This incumbency of old ideas (like ‘all of the above’ energy policy) must end,” the donors wrote.The effort comes just days after Mr. Biden denounced President Trump as a “climate arsonist” and made the case that Americans suffering from wildfires, floods and hurricanes could not afford four more years of a climate-change denier in the White House. Even many of Mr. Biden’s persistent critics on the left described it as the most aggressive and detailed policy speech on climate change ever given by a presidential candidate.",https://nytimes.com/2020/09/22/climate/biden-climate-change.html?searchResultPosition=10,"Democratic Donors Push Biden for a Cabinet Free of Fossil Fuel Connections

Biden, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, has been a vocal critic of the fossil fuel industry. In an interview with The Huffington Post, he said, ""I don't think it's fair to say that we're going to have a clean energy future. I think we need to do something about it."" He also said that if he were elected president he would ""take a hard look at what's going on in this country and what we can do to make sure that it doesn't happen again.""",Huggingface
